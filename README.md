# React-Jest-Enzyme
"Boiler" for showcasing testing React components with Jest and Enzyme.
<br>
Dependencies and file structure are setup correctly, just need to write some sample tests.
<br>

## Use
```npm install```<br>
```npm run test```

It's not really necessary to test with Jest, but if you want to run the webpack dev server, just type: <br>
``` npm run dev```
